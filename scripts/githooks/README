# Git Commit Hooks

Please copy the contents of this folder to the .git/hooks folder in the root of this repository so that you can benefit from the magic of Git hooks.
Because Git hooks are local only (meaning they cannot be commited), this is a manual step that you, as a developer need to take in order to
setup you development environment properly.

At the moment, we have only a single `pre-commit` hook that will double check your config files before you are able to complete a commit. This
will keep you from accidentally committing a URL in the config that ends in a trailing `/`, which we have agreed is a convention that we follow.
